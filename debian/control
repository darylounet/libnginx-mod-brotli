Description: Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm 
 that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm,
 Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio
 comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.
 It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.
 The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932.
